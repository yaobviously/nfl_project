# Data Source

The data is sourced from the [nflfastR package](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases). 

In the [db_insert notebook](https://github.com/yaobviously/nfl_project/blob/main/notebooks/db_insert.ipynb) I upsert the data to an SQL database using the utilities defined in [db_utils](https://github.com/yaobviously/nfl_project/blob/main/db_utils.py).
